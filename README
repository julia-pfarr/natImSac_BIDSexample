# Example BIDS Physio-EyeTracking Dataset - Binocular Recordings

This repo serves as an example for the BIDS Physio-EyeTracking specification (binocular recordings). 

The sourcedata was retrieved from https://github.com/mszinte/natImSac. Only the Eye Tracking data of the original dataset as well as only a few participants with only 2 of total 10 runs were kept for this example dataset. 

Sourcedata was converted to raw data according to the BIDS Physio-EyeTracking specification using the [eye2bids](https://github.com/bids-standard/eye2bids) converter tool.
